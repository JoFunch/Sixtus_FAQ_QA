      <b>Following is a brief explanation of the various filtering options</b>
      <dl>
        <dd>Email Date Range: Items received/created within a date-range. 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Content-type: Where the content should be located 
        </dd><br />
        <dd>Accounts: Whose account(s) to search 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Account contains: to filter content in accounts based on a feature, for instance, their @domain (Sixtus-compliance.dk find GDPR-data in all accounts with @sixtus-compliance.dk in their email.) 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Senders: Based off of total list of email-senders within the accounts a user is able to interact with. A super-user list will contain a senders list of all senders of the total tenant as they have access to all accounts.  
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Sender-domain: A quicker way to narrow down senders by groups  
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Clear filter: Will Clear any and all filters inserted to a completely clear filter. 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Reset filter will assume a standard filter (which is by default set to include the entirety of the userâ€™s accessibility). 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Restore to Current Filter will restore any filters most recently inserted by then cleared.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>GDPR Classifications will allow users quickly to filter what type of GDPR-data they want to browse in their findings. The three-structure is interactive and may assume both Categories and Areas. 
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Usage and Example</h3>
    <p>Make sure to correctly clear the "Sender" or "Account" filters properly if a single email is to be selected. The filter will make a too large fetch if, for instance, the "Sender Domain" is full of entries while the "Sender" contains only a single account if the purpose was to find the single account.

      In the report-site, users may want to narrow down GDPR-data findings to
      find a distinct subsection of data. To do this, the filter may be accessed
      in the left corner.
      <dl>
        <dd>Email Date Range: Items received/created within a date-range. 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Content-type: Where the content should be located 
        </dd><br />
        <dd>Accounts: Whose account-inboxes to search 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Account contains: to filter content in accounts based on a feature, for instance, their @domain (Sixtus-compliance.dk find GDPR-data in all accounts with @sixtus-compliance.dk in their email.) 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Senders: Based off of total list of email-senders within the accounts a user is able to interact with. A super-user list will contain a senders list of all senders of the total tenant as they have access to all accounts.  
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Sender-domain: A quicker way to narrow down senders by groups  
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Clear filter: Will Clear any and all filters inserted to a completely clear filter. 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Reset filter will assume a standard filter (which is by default set to include the entirety of the userâ€™s accessibility). 
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>Restore to Current Filter will restore any filters most recently inserted by then cleared.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>GDPR Classifications will allow users quickly to filter what type of GDPR-data they want to browse in their findings. The three-structure is interactive and may assume both Categories and Areas.

    <h2>Vocabulary of Sixtus</h2>
    </center>
    <dl>
      <dt>Account & Account Scope</dt>
      <dd>“Accounts” are simplest thought of as emails but are actually a reference to the user-ID of a tenant which in turn an email is tied to. On occasion, companies may recycle the user-ids between employees. </dd>
      <dd>In context of the Sixtus Scanner, “Account Scope” refers to the number of accounts a particular account may view. Super-users have potential to view as many has an entire tenant, as they are typically the ones doing the GDPR-process/policy work and must access the statistical overview and data-logs to document GDPR-progress.</dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Area & Domain</dt>
      <dd>“Area” in graphs and report-columns refer to the overarching knowledge-domain which a GDPR-case pertains. “Area” is the first division of GDPR-data into finer-grained groups and will indicate a coarse topic to the user.  </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>GDPR Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11</dt>
      <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Cases & Entries</dt>
      <dd>The Sixtus Scanner refers to its findings as Cases or as Entries. These are observations made by the Scanner's analysis engine and can be viewed in the report-site in depth in what text in each row are highlighted in the Entry-column. There is no distinction between types of Cases, which is to say that GDPR Confidential and GDPR Sensitive are both Cases.  
      </dd>
      </dt>
      <br>
      <dt>Categories</dt>
      <dd>
        As term, “Category” points directly to one of the three overarching
        GDPR-article and their expected inherent behaviours and safety,
        documentation, and deletion requirements. The Categories may therefore
        be seen as a direct manifestation of the GDPR articles, which are meant
        to ease the categorisation of GDPR-data found in a tenant according to
        its general, supposed treatment.
        <br>

        <dd>The three articles are: 

          <ul> Article 5 (Green, called “GDPR”) </ul>
          
          <ul> Article 9 (Red, called “GDPR Sensitive”) </ul>
          
         <ul> Article 10 & 11 (Yellow, called “GDPR Confidential”) </ul>
        </dd>
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Classifications</dt>
      <dd>The “Classification” of GDPR-data points towards a subsection within an Area and in turn Categorisation the GDPR-data is located in. XXXXX </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Confidential Data</dt>
      <dd>Confidential, as per the Data Category, is a type of data specifically pertaining data of legal, financial, or identification nature. It carries the Yellow colour in the Sixtus Scanner and Outlook Tag.</dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Overview-page</dt>
      <dd>Refers to the graphical front page of the Cloud Scanner Web Application. </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Report-page</dt>
      <dd>Refers to the row site with GDPR Entries. </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Sensitive Data</dt>
      <dd>Sensitive Data is a type of data pertaining health related information or affiliation information (meaning specific types of opinions, memberships or preferences). Such information is dyed red in the Overview, Report site and in Outlook’s tags. </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Super-user</dt>
      <dd>A user with more priviledges than the regular user. Typically, these are either IT-specialists or HR-employeeswith responsibility in either the company’s Cloud or GDPR-processes. </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Tenant</dt>
      <dd>
        A Tenant is a sandbox-type environment in Microsoft Office 365 Data
        Centre. A tenant is thus a facilitator of numerous items, such as mails
        and cloud-storage/Exchange, domains, web-applications, PowerBI and so on
        for companies and their employees.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        When Sixtus refer to a “subscription” or “Tenant”, we specifically mean
        the subscription which the company has in the MO0365 Data Centre, which
        holds all the users of the company. Typically, it would occur once we
        explain the scope of the scanner in terms of its user-reach; The Sixtus
        Scanner scans specific items within the company’s tenant, its o365 mail,
        SharePoint and OneDrive.

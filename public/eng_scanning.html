    <h2>Scanning</h2>
    </center>
        <p>This page hopes to bring as much transparency to the scanner and its logics and functionality for its users to understand.
    <h2>The First Scan</h2>
    <p>Once the scanner is installed, the scanner does by default not initiate any scanning. This default setting prevents any unwanted scanning-initiation and allows the company to control the initiation, scalability, quaratine-template setup, and cloud resources of the scanner.
        <br /> <br />
        A Superuser must in their Configuration-page allow users to be scanned or skipped before the scanners ingestion function will feed the scanning-queue.
        Once users are added, the scanner will begin scanning and not before. 
        <br /><br />
        Once the Scanner is initiated, the scanner operates until it has completed the added accounts. The Scanner will queue mails, attachments, OneDrive, and SharePoint until the queue is depleted. Users may always be added or skipped in the Configuration-Page.

    </p>
    <h2>A Regular Scan</h2>
    <p>Once the scanner is up to date (i.e nothing in its queue), it will enter another "mode" of operation. Here, the scanner will go into sleep-mode at 6 PM Central European Time and resume at 8 AM and complete sleep during the weekends.

    <h3>Something in queue</h3>
    <p>As a rule, the scanner's ingestion function continuously feeds a scanner's queue, and in turn, if there is something in queue, the scanner will continue to scan.
        <br />
    <p>That means that while the scanner does have a sleep-mode, but the sleepmode is only activated once the scanner is done with what had been selected by the super-user (i.e. once the queue is empty). 
        By this logic, the scanner will not enter sleep mode when the company scales its users in the scanner, but work until completion.

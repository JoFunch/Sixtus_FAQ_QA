    <div class="first-div">Report-page.</div>
    <p>
      The report-page is the section of the website where users may view all the
      GDPR Cases found in their Account Scope. Super-users will have more
      Accounts in their scope as they (likely) are administrators of the
      GDPR-process within the company. The report-page is where the user is sent
      once they have filtered in the Overview-Page and may view whatever section
      of data selected.
    </p>
    <p>The report-page consists of three components: 
      <ul>a CSV-generation button,</ul>
      <ul> a Filter-button, </ul>
      <ul> and selected GDPR-data. </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The CSV button will prompt a download of a CSV-file where the selected data is inserted per column into a downloadable file. This data can be used in companies own BI or used as documentation of IT-certifications, breaches, data-policies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>The Data-Filter button alters the (sub)section data shown should the user wish to alter their query. 
    </p>
    <p>The GDPR-data appears in row-like entries where each GDPR-Case selected either through the Overview-page or Data-Filter can be viewed in detail. Each row consists of the following columns:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dd>Date: The timestamp which the message or file was received. 
      </dd>
      <dd>Account: Which account said message or file belongs (whose mailbox it was found in, and if SharePoint/OneDrive, whose account create/uploaded the file). 
      </dd>
      <dd>Message / File Information:
        <dl> Email
          <dd>From: Who sent the message
          </dd>
          <dd>To: Who received it (May say “multiple recepients”) 
          </dd>
          <dd>Folder: In what folder the user may find the email 
          </dd>
          <dd>Subject: The subject of the mail 
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>OneDrive & SharePoint
          <dd>Location: Specification of which storage 
          </dd>
          <dd>Filename
          </dd>
          <dd>Path: URL to the given path 
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dd>GDPR Components: holds an overview of the GDPR-Cases found within the mail or file and what components in that entry holds what. There are two forms:
      <dl>“Message Body”: -> X GDPR Entries
        <dd>The GDPR-Cases come from an email text-body 
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>Filename -> X GDPR Entries
        <dd>The GDPR-Cases come from an attachment, OneDrive or Sharepoint </dd>

        </dl> 
        <dl>If the GDPR-Component has an exclamation mark, the colour will indicate the nature of the GDPR-Case according to the colouring scheme on the front page. There exists only Red and Yellow marks
        </dl> 
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> If the user presses the “+” to the right, the GDPR-Case will open a drop-down which will showcase its details.
    </p>
    <p>The user may also check the box between the “Date” and “+” column, and a Delete-button will appear. The check-box is dynamic and the user may auto-select several GDPR-Cases/Entries at the time by hold down Shift while clicking. The column-top check-box auto-selects all GDPR-Cases in the set of Data. By clicking “Yes” on the delete button, the data is deleted from the statistics and will appear in the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder in the user’s Outlook.

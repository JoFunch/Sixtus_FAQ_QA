    <h2>Report-page.</h2>
    </center>
    <p>
      The report-page is the section of the website where users may view all the
      GDPR Cases found in their Account Scope. Super-users will have more
      Accounts in their scope as they (likely) are administrators of the
      GDPR-process within the company. The report-page is where the user is sent
      once they have filtered in the Overview-Page and may view whatever section
      of data selected.
    </p>
    <p>The report-page consists of three components: 
      <ul>a CSV-generation button which allows users to retrieve data shown in the report page (explained <a href="eng_report_filter.html">here)</a></ul>
      <ul>a Filter-button to assist with acccessing the sebsection of data desired</ul>
      <ul>and selected GDPR-data.</ul>

  </center>

      </dl>
      <dl>Filename -> X GDPR Entries
        <dd>The GDPR-Cases come from an attachment, OneDrive or Sharepoint </dd>

        </dl> 
        <dl>If the GDPR-Component has an exclamation mark, the colour will indicate the nature of the GDPR-Case according to the colouring scheme on the front page. There exists only Red and Yellow marks
        </dl> 
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> If the user presses the “+” to the right, the GDPR-Case will open a drop-down which will showcase its details.
    </p>
    <p>The user may also check the box between the “Date” and “+” column, and a Delete-button will appear. The check-box is dynamic and the user may auto-select several GDPR-Cases/Entries at the time by hold down Shift while clicking. The column-top check-box auto-selects all GDPR-Cases in the set of Data. By clicking “Yes” on the delete button, the data is deleted from the statistics and will appear in the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder in the user’s Outlook.

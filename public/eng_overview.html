    <p>
      This is your personal overview-site. It will show you your MS-account's scanned data according to data classification and time.
      <br><br>
      You can click around the charts and table to narrow the subsection of data you want to examine. 
      <br><br>
      The front page consists of the Top-bar statistical overview of the Tenant, two pie-charts and a diachronic table of data.
      <Center>
      <br><br>
      <h3> The statistical top-bar
      </h3>
      </Center>
      <br><br>

      <br> <br>
      <p>The top bar has 8 points divided into a total number and a count. The total numbers have the colour blue while the red colour shows count.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Emails (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) represent the total emails
          scanned in the Tenant and the count of emails in which there has been
          found any number of GDPR-related cases (If 1 email has 2 cases of GDPR,
          1 in the body and two in an attachment, there is 1 count of &#34;Email
          GDPR&#34; and 1 &#34;Scanned&#34; email). (What if the email has 0 count
          but 1 in attachments?)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Attachments (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) are similar to
          &#34;Emails&#34;, only that these two numbers only concern themselves
          with the attachments of emails (and not OneDrive or SharePoint)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Files (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) are exactly those of
          OneDrive and SharePoint collected into one.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Accounts is a stand-alone count and represents the number of Tenant
          Accounts scanned.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          GDPR Cases are the count of the total amount of Cases /observations of
          GDPR in the entire Tenant. These include all Cases found in Email,
          OneDrive, SharePoint, and Attachments. 1 GDPR Case equals to 1
          observation of GDPR-related information regardless of Category or Area
          or Time-stamp.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Pie charts

      <br><br>
      <p>
        The Overview-page also has the filtering option of selecting either / or
        only OneDrive, SharePoints or Emails (including Attachments).
      </p>

      <h3>Time Table </h3>
      and a diachronic chart which displays the data of the accounts of the tenant.

    <h2>Usage and Example
    </h2>
    </center>
    <p>
      The three data-representations are interactive and intertwined and will respond to each other; a click on either one will shape the rest of the Overview-page. 
      <br>Click around to filter through to the data you want to examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a user may click on the green "GDPR"-portion in the
      Category-chart, then select "Work"; as their Domain and on the
      REPORT-symbol in the temporal chart to extract all Work-related GDPR-Cases
      related to that user in that period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any change, deletions or new mails, is reflected in the statistics following the a regular database update happening every 5. minute. Simply refresh the page or press the "Refresh and Reload" button.

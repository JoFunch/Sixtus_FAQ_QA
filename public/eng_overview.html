    <h2>Overview-page</h2>
    </Center>
    <p>
      The front page consists of the Top-bar statistical overview of the Tenant,

      <br><br>
      <img src="picture\Components\Overview\OverviewTopBar.png" alt="Computer Man" style="max-width: 700px; height: auto;">

      <br> <br>

      two pie charts 
      <img src="picture\Components\Overview\Piecharts.png" alt="Computer Man" style="max-width: 700px; height: auto;">
      <br><br>
      and a diachronic chart which displays the data of the
      selected accounts of the tenant.
      <img src="picture\Components\Overview\Piecharts.png" alt="Computer Man" style="max-width: 700px; height: auto;">
      <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The charts and the figure represent the same data in three different ways;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>GDPR-data by Category</li>
      <li>GDPR-data by Domain,</li>
      <li>and data in Time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The three data-representations are interactive as well as act in
      hierarchy; a click on either one will shape the rest of the Overview-page
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a user may click on the green &#34;GDPR&#34;-portion in the
      Category-chart, then select &#34;Work&#34; as their Domain and on the
      REPORT-emoji in the temporal chart to extract all Work-related GDPR-Cases
      related to that user.
    </p>
    <p>
      This serves as an easy filtering tool so the user as quickly and easily
      may find what category in what time-period they desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &#34;Reset + Reload&#34;-button refreshes the overview site with the
      most recent scans should there be new cases to report. The button does not
      initialise any scanning itself nor use or deplete any internal resources;
      a mere fetch-button built-in.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Overview-page also has the filtering option of selecting either / or
      only OneDrive, SharePoints or Emails (including Attachments).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Overview-page is also a general statistical overview of the scanned
      Tenant, referred to as &#34;The Top Bar&#34;. The top bar has 8 points
      divided into a total number and a count. The total numbers have the colour
      blue while the red colour belongs to the count.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Emails (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) represent the total emails
        scanned in the Tenant and the count of emails in which there has been
        found any number of GDPR-related cases (If 1 email has 2 cases of GDPR,
        1 in the body and two in an attachment, there is 1 count of &#34;Email
        GDPR&#34; and 1 &#34;Scanned&#34; email). (What if the email has 0 count
        but 1 in attachments?)
      </li>
      <li>
        Attachments (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) are similar to
        &#34;Emails&#34;, only that these two numbers only concern themselves
        with the attachments of emails (and not OneDrive or SharePoint)
      </li>
      <li>
        Files (&#34;Scanned&#34; and &#34;GDPR&#34;) are exactly those of
        OneDrive and SharePoint collected into one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accounts is a stand-alone count and represents the number of Tenant
        Accounts scanned.
      </li>
      <li>
        GDPR Cases are the count of the total amount of Cases /observations of
        GDPR in the entire Tenant. These include all Cases found in Email,
        OneDrive, SharePoint, and Attachments. 1 GDPR Case equals to 1
        observation of GDPR-related information regardless of Category or Area
        or Time-stamp.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Any deletion made inside the cloud scanner is instantaneously (upon
      refresh + reload) reflect the statistical changes while the Top-Bar will
      update once the following ingestion function (Database call) runs. The
      default of the ingestion is 10 minutes and also requires a Refresh +
      Reload.

    <h2>Quarantine Folder and Email Deletion.</h2>
    </center>
    <p>This Section explains the flow and dynamics of deletio of emails and what users are to expect once initiating any type of deletion.</p>
    <center>
    <h3>Deletion through Sixtus Scanner</h3>
    </center>
      <p>Momentarily following a deletion of an email from the Sixtus Scanner Webapp, the mail-row will disappear from the report-site, while the Overview Page will update its statistics upon the following database-update (once every 5. minute). 
        <br>
        The email containing GDPR-data will immediately be transported to the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder created in the mailbox of whomever "owned" the email.  
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of the GDPR Quarantine folder is to act as a GDPR-data ONLY folder, so that the GDPR-data deleted within an account is always accessible without the necessity to filter between unwanted or already deleted mail.
          
  <p>Any deletion made inside the cloud scanner is instantaneously (upon refresh + reload) reflected in the statistical oveve rview while the Top-Bar will update once the following ingestion function (Database call) runs. The default of the ingestion is 10 minutes and also requires a Refresh + Reload.</p>

  <h3  >Deletion in Outlook </h3>
  </center>
  <p>If a user decides instead to delete tagged emails from their outlook directly, their emails will as usual go to their "Deleted Folder" and not rerouted through their Quarantine Folder.</p><br>
  <p>Furthermore, by default, the scanner does not track items in the deleted folder, be it GDPR-tagged or not. This is to avoid any confusion between web-app deletions and regular outlook-deletions and in continuation as to what is being displayed in the web-app. </p>
  <br>
  <p>It is only the default Deleted Folder which the Scanner ignores; any custom-made folders with deletion-rules similar to that of the trash-can will be included in the scanner's statisitics and report-page. </p>

    <h2>Quarantine Folder and Email Deletion.</h2>
    <p>
      In the report-page, there is a multi-selector whose purpose is to allow
      for (multiple) deletion of emails. The user may freely delete mails from
      the section of the Tenants (however many accounts) they have access to.
      Once selected, a button will appear to delete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Momentarily following its deletion, the mail-row will disappear from the report-site and from the statistics. The email containing GDPR-data will immediately be transported to the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder created in the mailbox of whomever the deleted mail(s) belonged.  
    </p
    <p>
      The purpose of the folder is three-fold:
      <ul>
        <li>It will act as a GDPR-data-ONLY-folder, so that the GDPR-data deleted within an account is always accessible without the necessity to filter between unwanted or already deleted mail.
          
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The folder also has an inherent deletion-policy; emails within the folder will automatically be deleted after 180 days without transit to the “deleted”-folder of an account. To avoid confusion, each email will have to exceed 180 days from the time it was moved to the Quarantine Folder to be deleted; the folder does not empty itself after 180 days of its creation / first emails being moved into it. 
    
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The 180 days acts as a minimum retainment of data in accordance with GDPR and, to the user, acts as possibility to revert deletions. 

        </li>
      </ul>
  <p>Any deletion made inside the cloud scanner is instantaneously (upon refresh + reload) reflected in the statistical oveve rview while the Top-Bar will update once the following ingestion function (Database call) runs. The default of the ingestion is 10 minutes and also requires a Refresh + Reload.</p>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Deletion of emails from the Outlook-app </h2>
  <p>If a user decides instead to delete tagged emails from their outlook directly, their emails will as usual go to their "Deleted Folder" and not rerouted through their Quarantine Folder.</p><br>
  <p>Furthermore, by default, the scanner does not track items in the deleted folder, be it GDPR-tagged or not. This is to avoid any confusion between web-app deletions and regular outlook-deletions and in continuation as to what is being displayed in the web-app. </p>
  <br>
  <p>It is only the default Deleted Folder which the Scanner ignores; any custom-made folders with deletion-rules similar to that of the trash-can will be included in the scanner's statisitics and report-page. </p>

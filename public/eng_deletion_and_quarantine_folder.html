    <h2>Quarantine Folder and Email Deletion.</h2>
    </center>
    <p>This Section explains the flow and dynamics of deletio of emails and what users are to expect once initiating any type of deletion.</p>

    <h3>Deletion through Sixtus Scanner</h3>
    </center>
      <p>Momentarily following a deletion of an email from the Sixtus Scanner Webapp, the mail-row will disappear from the report-site, while the Overview Page will update its statistics upon the following database-update (once every 5. minute). 
        <br><br>
        The email containing GDPR-data will immediately be transported to the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder created in the mailbox of whomever "owns" the email.  </p>

    <p>The purpose of the GDPR Quarantine folder is to act as a GDPR-data ONLY folder, so that the GDPR-data deleted within an account is always accessible without the necessity to filter between spam or already deleted mail.
      <br><br>
      The Quarantine Folder is disregarded in the statsitics, so any deletions made directly impacts the stastistics. There

        It is also important to note that there is no automatic deletion involved in the Quarantine folder. The folder, then, has to be emptied / deleted by the user through Outlook. This decision is made for safety reasons

  <h3  >Deletion in Outlook </h3>
  </center>
  <p>If a user decides instead to delete tagged emails from their outlook directly, their emails will as usual go to their "Deleted Items" and not rerouted through their Quarantine Folder.</p><br>
  <p>By default, the scanner does not show in the report nor in statistics items in the deleted folder or the Quarantine folder, be it GDPR-tagged or not. This is to avoid any confusion reading the statistics in the web-app. </p>
  <br>
  <p>It is only the standard "Deleted Items" which the Scanner ignores of all the regular folders; any custom-made folders with deletion-rules similar to that of "Deleted Items" will be included in the scanner's statisitics and report-page. </p>

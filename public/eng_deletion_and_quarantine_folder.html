    <h2>Quarantine Folder and Email Deletion.</h2>
    </center>
    <p>This Section explains the flow and dynamics of deletion of emails and what users are to expect once initiating any type of deletion.</p>

    <h3>Deletion through Sixtus Scanner</h3>
    </center>
      <p>Momentarily after a deletion of an email from the Sixtus Scanner Webapp, the mail-row will disappear from the report-site. Afterwards, the Overview Page will update its statistics upon the following database-update (an update happening once every 5. minute). 
        <br><br>
        The email containing GDPR-data will immediately be transported to the “GDPR Quarantine”-folder created in the mailbox of whomever "owns" the email from it's Outlook-folder.  </p>

    <p>The purpose of the GDPR Quarantine folder is to act as a GDPR-data ONLY folder, so that the GDPR-data deleted in an inbox is always accessible without the necessity to filter between spam or already deleted mail and is always safe.
      <br><br>
      The Quarantine Folder is disregarded in the statsitics, so any deletions made directly impacts the stastistics.
      <Br><Br>
        It is also important to note that there is no automatic deletion involved in the Quarantine folder. The folder, then, has to be emptied / deleted by the user through Outlook. This decision is made for safety reasons
    </p>

  <h3>Deletion in Outlook </h3>
  </center>
  <p>If a user decides instead to delete tagged emails from their Outlook directly, their emails will as usual go to their "Deleted Items" and not rerouted through their Quarantine Folder.</p>
  <p>By default, the scanner does not show in the report nor in statistics items in the deleted folder or the Quarantine folder, be it GDPR-tagged or not. This is to avoid any confusion understanding the statistics in the web-app. </p>

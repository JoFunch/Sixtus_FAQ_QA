      <h2>What is and what does the Sixtus Cloud Scanner do?</h2>
      <p>
        Sixtus Cloud Scanner is a piece of software installed in a company's MS
        Azure cloud-platform (what we refer to as the "tenant") similar to other
        regular applications like Outlook, Word, Excel, etc. <br /><br />

        The Scanner is given access to the email and attachments of the
        Outlook-app and files of OneDrive and SharePoint stored on the tenant.
        The Scanner in turn scans files stored in these applications for
        personal identifiable information as defined in the EU's GDPR directive.

        <br /><br />

        The Scanner finds personal identifiable information in textual,
        tabulated, and image data and shows its observations in a user-friendly
        and dynamic way. On the company Scanner web-page accessiable to every
        employee, a user may view the data found related to that user.

        <br /><br />

        Data is easily filtered and maneuvred through on the Scanner web-page,
        whether it is by date, sender/receiver or any classification of data,
        and the web-page also offers seamless deletion of PII-related items.
      </p>
      <h2>What can the Scanner do for employees and companies?</h2>
      <p>
        The Scanner is a tool enabling employees to practically engage GDPR
        compliance work. This means that the scanner handles identifying,
        classifying and logging of any personal identifiable information found
        within a Tenant and furthermore encourages data-minisation through
        deletion as well as report-generation for documentational purposes.

        <br /><br />

        Employees are liberated the task of finding and identifying sensitive
        data across a vast data-platform as well as requiring the necessary
        knowledge and education to understand and classify said data. Instead,
        employees can focus on their area of expertise and enjoy handling
        compliance work through clicks of a few buttons.

        <br />

        Companies may also on a higher level draw use of the scanner. While
        employees collectively work towards individual data minimisation, a
        company may generate reports of the overall progress to document other
        compliance progresses such as data- and deletion policies, ISO/ISAE
        certifications, and so on. The Scanner also serves as bulwark against
        data breaches.
